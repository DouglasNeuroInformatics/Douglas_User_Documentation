# Getting started

Hello. Happy to get you started

## Set up a user account

User account creation is handled by-request via email to
[support@douglasneuroinformatics.ca](mailto:support@douglasneuroinformatics.ca).

Requests must be submitted by the **supervising principal investigator**.

Principal investigators may also request creation of a lab group if one does
not already exist.

Once accounts have been created new users will be invited to meet in person
(or via video chat) to set a password for their accounts.
