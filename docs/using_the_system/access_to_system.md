# Accessing the System

The platform can be accessed in a number of ways:

1. Physical access
2. Remote access within the Douglas.
3. Remote access outside the Douglas.

## Physical Access

Physical access to a suite of workstations is available inside the Douglas CIC,
contact the CIC Administrative Assistant (Louis Th√©roux) for keycard access.

## Remote Access within the Douglas

All platform hardware is acccessible within the Douglas Research Center network
via `ssh`. The main userserver is available at `cicus03`, the storage server
at `cicss03` and workstations are available in the range `cicws[01..41]`.

```{admonition} Playing nice
Neuroinformatics workstations all allow for multiple simultaneous users, please
make a best effort to choose a workstation not already being used by others.

The command [`who`](https://linuxize.com/post/who-command-in-linux/) can list
currently logged-in users, while [`htop`](https://htop.dev/) will show
a graphical display of the current state of CPU and Memory utilization.

In general, fewer users is better, as well as low CPU and
memory utilization (represented by the length of the horizonal coloured bars
in `htop`)

```

## Remote Access outside the Douglas

Remote access from outside the Douglas is provided by authorization only.
Please contact the platform to request access.
