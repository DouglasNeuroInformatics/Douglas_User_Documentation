# Douglas Neuroinformatics Platform Documentation
Welcome to the [**Douglas Neuroinformatics Platform (DNP)**](about_the_platform/index.md) documentation.
```{warning}
**Home folder quota: 300 GB**

Each user’s **home folder is limited to 300 GB**.

Home folders should be used for code, configuration files, and small test files.  
**All imaging and project data must be stored in shared/project storage locations, _not_ in your home folder.**
```
If you’re **new to the platform**, start with:  
* [Getting started](getting_started/index.md) to set up your user account and learn the basics

If you’re an **existing user**, see  
*  [Using the system](using_the_system/index.md) for details on access, data, and software
*  [Research methods](research_methods/index.md) for guidance on sharing datasets
